                    <b>Hello there!</b> My name is Demian, also known as Codeah online.
                    I'm originally from the Netherlands and am currently studying
                    Computer Engineering in Warsaw, Poland. I speak fluent English, 
                    Dutch and Russian.
                </p>
                <p>    
                    I have been interested in programming since the age of ten. Now,
                    almost a decade later I am still heavily invested in computer 
                    programming. Some of my recent projects include: a Discord 
                    currency bot written in Go that is active on over one 
                    hundred servers, an anonymous secret-sharing website written in 
                    Python using the Django framework and an open source multiplayer
                    video game mod.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aside from programming, I also enjoy playing the guitar and 
                    travelling! You can find some of the songs I have produced on my
                    <a href="https://soundcloud.com/codeah"><b>SoundCloud</b></a>!
