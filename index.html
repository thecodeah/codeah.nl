                    <b>Hello there!</b> My name is Demian, also known as Codeah
                    online. I'm a twenty-year-old Software Developer living in
                    The Hague, Netherlands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am experienced with a wide variety of creative tools and
                    technical skills and speak fluent English, Dutch and
                    Russian. Adapting to new development tools, workflows or
                    programming languages has never been an issue for me.
                    However, my current primary technology are Typescript and
                    React. Some of my projects include: a Discord currency bot
                    written in Golang that is currently active on around 600
                    servers, serving roughly ten thousand users. An anonymous
                    secret-sharing website written in Python using the Django
                    framework and an open source typing game written using the
                    Arcade library.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aside from programming, I also enjoy playing the guitar,
                    playing the keyboard and producing music. Within my lifetime
                    I have lived in multiple countries for a few years at a
                    time, familiarizing myself with multiple cultures and
                    traditions.
